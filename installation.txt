To install, drop the AEToolbox.jsx file into your After Effects ScriptUI Panels directory.  

By default, this is:

Mac:
/Applications/YOUR AFTER EFFECTS VERSION/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/

Windows:
C:\Program Files\YOUR AFTER EFFECTS VERSION\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\

After restarting After Effects, you can access the AEToolbox panel from the Window menu, just like your other panels.
